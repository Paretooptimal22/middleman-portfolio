        <h2>👋 About</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Kevin</strong> and I'm from <strong> ☀️ Orange County, California</strong></p>
        <p>I came to Tokyo to attend <strong>Le Wagon's Web Development Bootcamp</strong>
        and completed the 9 week course at the end of August 2024. Currently, I am working on personal projects
        and looking for opportunities in Tokyo 🗼!</p>
        <p>When not coding, I like to do photography 📸, watch anime 📺, or play sports ⚽️ ⛳️ 🏀.</p>
